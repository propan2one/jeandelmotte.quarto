My work focuses on creating complex bioinformatics analysis for the pharmaceutical industry.\nIn this blog I study the scientific fields that interest me (pangenomics, data workflows and pipelines..). I also talk about my feelings in the pharmaceutical environment after my career in academia, and I express opinions that are my own and commit only myself."

However, these advances are not always used, so let’s take a look back at the history of analysis methods over the last 10 years.\n\n\nTo fully understand what these modalities refer to, II need to introduce you to the notion that I call the different generations, often speaking of the Generation I, II or III pipeline (abbreviated as GI, GII etc..). Of course, defined limits are not so clearly defined, and often generations of tools coexist within a lab or organization.\n\nGeneration 0\nLet’s start with an era I’ve never known (I’ve only been doing bioinfo for 7 years), which includes the beginnings of bioinformatics. Here I call the tools used generation 0."
