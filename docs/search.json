    "text": "Image from TheOrsna in Pixabay\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most cost-effective things bioinformatics can do is to simulate giving. These simulations are an underestimated research tool. We often simulate data to benchmark different algorithms or to perform unit tests on our analysis pipelines. From my personal point of view, it’s possible to go further: if we understand a biological problem, then we should be able to simulate data. If the entire problem is correctly understood, then the analysis of simulated and experimental data should lead to the same conclusion. This validates that the mechanism is well understood.\nIn this post, I’ll describe how to create a small synthetic genomes, assign mutations to it and simulate mutations at a spcific frequencies. The aim is to create a minimal dataset to facilitate unit testing of my pipelines."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today, the volume of data to be analysed in bioinformatics is such that it’s essential to use a number of tools to produce results in a consistent timeframe. However, these advances are not always used, so let’s take a look back at the history of analysis methods over the last 10 years.\nTo fully understand what these modalities refer to, I need to introduce you to the notion that I call the different generations, often speaking of the generation I, II or III pipeline (abbreviated as GI, GII etc..). Of course, defined limits are not so clearly defined, and often generations of tools coexist within a lab or organization. I’ll now describe what I consider to be the different generations, and then conclude by explaining the advantages of such a category. If you’re a bioinformatician, you can go straight to the GII pipeline."
