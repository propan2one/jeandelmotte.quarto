I also talk about my feelings in the pharmaceutical environment after my career in academia, and I express opinions that are my own and commit only myself."

    "text": "Image from TheOrsna in Pixabay\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most cost-effective things bioinformatics can do is to simulate giving. These simulations are an underestimated research tool. We often simulate data to benchmark different algorithms or to perform unit tests on our analysis pipelines. From my personal point of view, it’s possible to go further: if we understand a biological problem, then we should be able to simulate data. If the entire problem is correctly understood, then the analysis of simulated and experimental data should lead to the same conclusion. This validates that the mechanism is well understood.\nIn this post, I’ll describe how to create a small synthetic genomes, assign mutations to it and simulate mutations at different frequencies. The aim is to create a minimal dataset to facilitate unit testing of my pipelines."
