Today, the volume of data to be analysed in bioinformatics is such that it's essential to use a number of tools to produce results in a consistent timeframe. However, these advances are not always used, so let's take a look back at the history of analysis methods over the last 10 years.

To fully understand what these modalities refer to, II need to introduce you to the notion that I call the different **generations**, often speaking of the Generation I, II or III pipeline (abbreviated as GI, GII etc..). Of course, defined limits are not so clearly defined, and often generations of tools coexist within a lab or organization.


### Generation 0

Let's start with an era I've never known  (I've only been doing bioinfo for 7 years), which includes the beginnings of bioinformatics. Here I call the tools used **generation 0**.
